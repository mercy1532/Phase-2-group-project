**Business Problem**

Real estate is a highly dynamic market influenced by numerous factors. This makes it challenging for real estate investors to accurately predict house prices.Inaccurate pricing models can lead to reduced profitability, missed opportunities, and dissatisfied customers.The current pricing strategy of the real estate company is suboptimal, leading to potential loss of revenue and increased customer dissatisfaction.Hence, the need for a robust predictive pricing model to enable companies to stay competitive and adapt to market fluctuations.

**Project Overview**

This project is an attempt to help real estate investors make informed decisions on what type of houses they should invest in.This is in terms of the most impactful features, both positively and negatively, on House prices.The components of the analysis include Data preparation, Feature selection and Engineering, Model Development, Evaluation, and Validation.

**The Data**

- For this project, we use the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in kc_house_data.csv in the data folder in this GitHub repository.

**Methods**

- The methods used on the dataset include Data Preparation, Feature selection and Engineering, Model Development, Evaluation, and Validation.

**Results**

- From the model created and analyzed, we were able to note that:

    i). The 'grade' feature has the greatest impact on house prices in general.
 
    ii). Features with higher grade classification i.e. grade_13 Mansion,grade_12 Luxury, and grade_11 Excellent, have the most positive impact on house prices.
 
    iii). Features with lower grade classification i.e. grade_7 Average and smaller square footage above ground(log_sqft_above), have the most negative impact on house prices.
 
    iv). Houses with a waterfront were highly priced compared to those without.
 
**Recommendations**

- Based on the results obtained, the following conclusions were made:

  1). Real estate investors seeking premium returns should consider the grade of the house.

  2). Real estate investors should recognize the positive impact of larger living areas as indicated by the log_sqft_living variable to fetch higher returns.

  3). Real estate investors should also consider waterfront views as they also positively impact house prices.

  4). Investors should be mindful of features with a negative impact on house prices such as lower-grade classifications ("Average") and smaller square footage above ground(log_sqft_above).
